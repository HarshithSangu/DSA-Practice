# Binary Search

## Status
In Progress (Day 5)

## Day 1 – What I Covered
- Binary search intuition (dictionary example)
- Linear vs binary search
- Iterative binary search
- Recursive binary search
- Time complexity O(log n)
- Safe mid calculation
- Lower bound & upper bound
- Floor and ceil
- First and last occurrence
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Finding minimum in rotated sorted array

## Notes
Handwritten notes for Day 1 are uploaded as PDF.

## Day 2 Progress
- Number of rotations in rotated sorted array
- Finding minimum element and its index
- Single element in sorted array using binary search
- Peak element problem
- Binary search on answers (square root of a number)
- Focused on dry runs, conditions, and edge cases

## Day 3 Progress 
-understood nth root of a number using binary search
-done based on binary search on answers 
-here one overflow happens when you calculate power of mid with given n then it overflows
-understood koko eating bananas this is also bs on answers like we need min no of bananas per/hr

## Day 4 Progress
-understood some more concepts on binary search on answers 
-for koko eating banans within required time we are calculating time 1 banana/hr and 2 banana/hr and taking only if it is within time 
-similarly same pattern for least capacity to ship all packages within d days like we take capacities and for each capacity we calculate no of days and if it is within d days then among them we take minimum capcity
-minimum no of days to make m bouqets and in each bouqet k flowers they must be adjacent only
-minimum small divisor less than the threshold

## Day5 Progress
-understood kth missing positive integer here we are not using binary search on answers and to find how many integers are missed before that element we use this formula like element-(index+1) 
-tomorrow i will learn new type patterns like max of min
## Next Plan
- Practice coding problems for above concepts
- Write clean implementations with edge case handling
