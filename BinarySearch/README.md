# Binary Search

## Status
In Progress (Day 3)

## Day 1 – What I Covered
- Binary search intuition (dictionary example)
- Linear vs binary search
- Iterative binary search
- Recursive binary search
- Time complexity O(log n)
- Safe mid calculation
- Lower bound & upper bound
- Floor and ceil
- First and last occurrence
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Finding minimum in rotated sorted array

## Notes
Handwritten notes for Day 1 are uploaded as PDF.

## Day 2 Progress
- Number of rotations in rotated sorted array
- Finding minimum element and its index
- Single element in sorted array using binary search
- Peak element problem
- Binary search on answers (square root of a number)
- Focused on dry runs, conditions, and edge cases

## Day 3 Progress 
-understood nth root of a number using binary search
-done based on binary search on answers 
-here one overflow happens when you calculate power of mid with given n then it overflows
-understood koko eating bananas this is also bs on answers like we need min no of bananas per/hr
## Next Plan
- Practice coding problems for above concepts
- Write clean implementations with edge case handling
