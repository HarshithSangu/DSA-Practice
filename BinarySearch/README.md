## Status
In Progress (Day 1)

## What I Covered Today
- Binary search intuition (dictionary example)
- Linear vs binary search
- Iterative binary search
- Recursive binary search
- Time complexity O(log n)
- Safe mid calculation
- Lower bound & upper bound
- Floor and ceil
- First and last occurrence
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Finding minimum in rotated sorted array

## Notes
Handwritten notes for Day 1 are uploaded as PDF.

## Next Plan
- cover more concepts like binary search on answers
- practice problems based on concepts
